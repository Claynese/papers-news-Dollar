        <div class="box box2">In March, the ruble continued to strengthen against world currencies. Since the beginning of the month, the official dollar exchange rate has lost almost 3.48% against the ruble and dropped to ₽84.64 as of the weekend of March 22-23. Over the same period, the euro fell by 0.66% to ₽91.4262, the yuan by 3.16% to ₽11.5779. Within the month, the ruble's fluctuations in the direction of strengthening were even more significant. So, on March 19, the Central Bank set the official dollar exchange rate at ₽81.5018, which was the lowest value since June 8, 2023. A day earlier, on March 18, on the over-the—counter Forex market, the dollar-ruble pair came close to the level of ₽80 - the dollar-ruble exchange rate fell below ₽81, updating the lows since June 2023.</div>
        <div class="box box3">According to Yuri Kravchenko, Head of the Banking and Money Market Analysis Department at IC Veles Capital, the main reason for the strengthening of the ruble in March was an improvement in geopolitical expectations. "This factor allows investors to hope for a future easing of foreign trade restrictions for Russia and a possible easing of restrictions on the movement of capital — the return of non—residents to the Russian market," the expert explains. Both events could significantly improve the inflow of foreign currency liquidity to the Russian market and thereby strengthen the ruble exchange rate, Kravchenko believes. Mikhail Vasiliev, chief analyst at Sovcombank, notes that according to statistics from previous years, April is one of the most favorable months of the year for the ruble. There is also a seasonally low demand for foreign currency in April, he adds. RBC Investments learned from experts what the main factors will affect the ruble exchange rate in April, as well as what range of exchange rates they expect next month.</div>
        <div class="box box4">What will happen to the dollar exchange rate in April 2025: expert forecasts Mikhail Vasiliev, chief analyst at Sovcombank: "We believe that in April the ruble will trade in the range of ₽78-85 per dollar, ₽86-93 per euro, ₽10.7–11.7 per yuan." Natalia Pyrieva, a leading analyst at Digital Broker: "Given the increased volatility in the Russian market, the ruble can show strong impulse movements in both directions — the range can be wide — from ₽80 to ₽110 per dollar. We believe that the ruble is close to the peak of its strengthening in the current cycle, spring export inflows will be lower than winter ones, and import demand will increase, so the ruble will gradually begin to return to ₽90 per dollar in the near future." Natalia Vashchelyuk, senior analyst at the First Management Company: "Unless there is a significant change in external conditions (both improvement and deterioration), the dollar exchange rate is likely to be in the range of 80-90,80, yuan — 11-12,4". Alexander Potavin, Finam Financial Group analyst: We expect the dollar exchange rate to rise in April.</div>

        <div class="box box6">Why change the design of dollars. First of all, this is done to combat counterfeiting. "The main purpose of the design changes is to make banknotes more secure from counterfeiters," Ilya Makar explained. The attackers are not far behind those who create real dollars. Pretty quickly, they figure out how to forge even the latest banknotes. Therefore, it is necessary to regularly change the design, while using all the capabilities of modern technologies. With each update, new security features are added, such as microtexts, three-dimensional security features, and complex watermarks. This complicates the process of counterfeiting bills. In addition, the innovations are aimed at making banknotes more modern and recognizable. "The changes in the design of dollars are the result of a comprehensive approach to ensuring the security and reliability of the currency, as well as the desire to improve its appearance and usability," concluded Ilya Makar.</div>
        <div class="box box7">The validity period of the old dollars. Old and new dollars have the same value in terms of exchange for goods and services. This is stated in American laws. This means that dollars do not have an expiration date: old bills are considered valid in the same way as new ones. But there is a caveat in the law: it applies only to government agencies. This means that exchangers and private companies can set the rules themselves. There is no federal law that would prohibit them from imposing restrictions on accepting old dollars. However, local laws may be introduced in states and even individual cities.</div>
        <div class="box box8">How to change dollars. The exchange of new dollars usually does not cause problems, as they have an improved design and protection against counterfeiting. Owners of old dollars may face problems when exchanging for local currency in exchangers and banks in different countries. "Banks and private organizations are particularly wary of old dollars and euros issued before 1996," the expert added. It is important to pay attention to the condition of the bill. If it is dirty, torn and too badly damaged, there may be problems during the exchange. Moreover, each organization has its own requirements. For example, Sberbank will not accept or exchange dollars with the security thread removed. Problems will also arise when exchanging bills that are very wet. The fact is that after exposure to water, oil, ink and other liquids, the structure of the bill changes, which is why it begins to glow in UV rays. And if, after interacting with the liquid, more than 50 percent of the banknote's area has acquired a blue glow under ultraviolet light, it will not be accepted. It happens</div>
